# Navigating the Directory System in Ubuntu

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to navigate through the directory systems in Ubuntu using the terminal. Understanding the directory structure and commands to move around is fundamental for efficient system management.

## Overview of the Linux Directory System

The Linux directory system is often modeled like a tree, starting with the root directory (`/`). From this root, various branches (directories) extend, each potentially containing more branches (subdirectories) and leaves (files). Moving through directories in Linux via the terminal is akin to traversing this tree.

## Viewing the Current Directory with `pwd`

To display the current directory, use the `pwd` (print working directory) command:

```bash
pwd
```

Example output:

```plaintext
/home/user
```

This command shows the full path of the current directory.

## Listing Files and Directories with `ls`

The `ls` (list) command lists files and directories in the current directory.

### Basic Usage

To list files and directories:

```bash
ls
```

Example output:

```plaintext
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Videos
```

### Long Listing Format

For a detailed view, use the `-l` option:

```bash
ls -l
```

Example output:

```plaintext
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jun  1 10:00 Desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  220 Jun  1 10:00 example.txt
```

### Listing Hidden Files

To include hidden files (files starting with a dot), use the `-a` option:

```bash
ls -a
```

Example output:

```plaintext
.  ..  .bashrc  .profile  Desktop  Documents
```

### Combining Options

Options can be combined to provide more detailed output:

```bash
ls -la
```

## Changing Directories with `cd`

The `cd` (change directory) command changes the current directory.

### Basic Usage

To change to a directory:

```bash
cd <directory>
```

Example:

```bash
cd Documents
```

Use `pwd` to confirm the change:

```bash
pwd
```

Example output:

```plaintext
/home/user/Documents
```

### Moving Up One Directory

To move up one level in the directory tree:

```bash
cd ..
```

### Moving to the Home Directory

To quickly move to your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

Or simply:

```bash
cd
```

### Absolute vs. Relative Paths

- **Absolute Path**: Specifies the full path from the root directory.

  ```bash
  cd /home/user/Documents
  ```

- **Relative Path**: Specifies the path relative to the current directory.

  ```bash
  cd Documents
  ```

## Creating Non-Root User Accounts

Running commands as the root user can be risky. It's good practice to use non-root accounts for regular tasks.

### Adding a New User

To create a new user named `mike`:

```bash
sudo adduser mike
```

Follow the prompts to set a password and provide additional information.

### Switching Users

To switch to a newly created user:

```bash
su mike
```

To return to the previous user:

```bash
exit
```

## Example Directory Navigation Commands

Here is a summary of essential commands for directory navigation:

1. **Print Working Directory**

   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

2. **List Files and Directories**

   ```bash
   ls
   ls -l
   ls -a
   ```

3. **Change Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <directory>
   cd ..
   cd ~
   cd /
   ```

4. **Add User**

   ```bash
   sudo adduser <username>
   ```

5. **Switch User**

   ```bash
   su <username>
   exit
   ```

## Example Usage

### Viewing Current Directory

```bash
pwd
```

Output:

```plaintext
/home/user
```

### Listing Files in Long Format

```bash
ls -l
```

Output:

```plaintext
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jun  1 10:00 Desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  220 Jun  1 10:00 example.txt
```

### Changing to a Directory

```bash
cd Documents
```

### Moving Up One Level

```bash
cd ..
```

### Changing to Home Directory

```bash
cd ~
```

### Adding a New User

```bash
sudo adduser mike
```

### Switching User

```bash
su mike
```
