# Using the Terminal in Ubuntu

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to interact with Ubuntu using the terminal. This method allows for more efficient and powerful management of the system compared to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). We will cover basic commands, user management, system information retrieval, and navigating manual pages.

## Accessing the Terminal

Ubuntu includes a terminal emulator by default. You can access it via the Applications menu or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + T`. Additionally, you may use other terminal emulators, such as `tilix`, which supports advanced features like terminal splitting.

## Understanding the Terminal Prompt

When you open the terminal, you are presented with a prompt that includes your username and hostname. For example:

```bash
user@ubuntu:~$
```

Here, `user` is the username, and `ubuntu` is the hostname. The prompt indicates that the terminal is ready to accept commands.

## Switching Users

To switch users, use the `su` (substitute user) command:

```bash
su <username>
```

For instance, to switch to a user named `user1`, you would type:

```bash
su user1
```

To return to the original user, type:

```bash
exit
```

## Identifying the Current User

To identify the current user, use the `whoami` command:

```bash
whoami
```

This will output the username of the current user.

## System Information with `uname`

The `uname` command provides system information. By default, it returns the kernel name:

```bash
uname
```

To get more detailed information, use options with the `uname` command:

- `-a`: All available system information
- `-s`: Kernel name
- `-n`: Network node hostname

Example:

```bash
uname -a
```

This command provides comprehensive details, including the kernel version, machine hardware name, and more.

## Clearing the Terminal

To clear the terminal screen, use:

```bash
clear
```

## Command Options and Help

Most terminal commands support options and help parameters. Use `-h` or `--help` to access help information. For example:

```bash
uname --help
```

This command displays all available options for the `uname` command.

## Using the Manual Pages

For detailed documentation, refer to the manual (man) pages:

```bash
man <command>
```

For example, to read the manual for the `uname` command:

```bash
man uname
```

Navigate through the manual using the arrow keys, and press `q` to quit.

## Example Commands Summary

Here is a summary of some essential commands and their functions:

1. **Switch User**

   ```bash
   su <username>
   exit
   ```

2. **Identify Current User**

   ```bash
   whoami
   ```

3. **System Information**

   ```bash
   uname
   uname -a
   uname -s
   uname -n
   ```

4. **Clear Terminal**

   ```bash
   clear
   ```

5. **Help and Manual Pages**

   ```bash
   uname --help
   man uname
   ```
