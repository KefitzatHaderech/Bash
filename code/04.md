# Installing New Software and Learning How To Use It

There are endless pieces of software that you can install onto your Linux machine that go beyond the base install package. If you have a specific need in mind, you can search the software repositories using the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT). Once you find your software, you can install it, reference the manual or help documentation to see how it operates, and begin using the new software to accomplish your goal.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Open up a terminal and update your current package information.**
   - `sudo apt update`

2. **Now, upgrade your packages.**
   - `sudo apt upgrade`

3. **Now that you are up to date, search the repositories for a piece of software called steghide.**
   - `apt search steghide`

4. **Before installing, show more details about the software and note the purpose of the software and which file types it works with.**
   - `apt show steghide`

5. **Change directories to /bin and display the contents to see if steghide is in the directory.**
   - `cd /bin`
   - `ls | grep steghide`

6. **Install the software.**
   - `sudo apt install steghide`

7. **Verify that steghide now exists in the /bin directory.**
   - `ls /bin | grep steghide`

8. **Read the manual for steghide and the help documentation to determine how this software works.**
   - `man steghide`
   - `steghide --help`

9. **Steghide is a steganography tool which can hide data (like a text file) into images or audio files.**
   - **Create or find a picture and a text file to use with steghide and place them in your Documents directory.**
   - `cp /path/to/your/image.jpg ~/Documents/`
   - `echo "This is a secret message" > ~/Documents/message.txt`

10. **Long list the files to view the size of each file.**
    - `ls -l ~/Documents`

11. **Use steghide to embed the text file into the picture.**
    - `steghide embed -cf ~/Documents/image.jpg -ef ~/Documents/message.txt`

12. **Delete the original text file.**
    - `rm ~/Documents/message.txt`

13. **Long list the files to view the size of each file and note any differences.**
    - `ls -l ~/Documents`

14. **Open the original picture and the embedded picture to see if you can note any differences.**
    - Use an image viewer to open the original and the modified image.

15. **Use Steghide to extract the embedded information from the picture.**
    - `steghide extract -sf ~/Documents/image.jpg`

16. **Display the contents of the information to verify that it is correct.**
    - `cat message.txt`

17. **Delete the files used in this example.**
    - `rm ~/Documents/image.jpg ~/Documents/message.txt`

18. **Uninstall Steghide from your Linux machine.**
    - `sudo apt remove steghide`

19. **View the contents of the /bin directory to verify that Steghide was removed.**
    - `ls /bin | grep steghide`

By following these steps, you will practice updating and upgrading packages, searching for and installing new software, using it, and then cleaning up by uninstalling the software and verifying its removal.
