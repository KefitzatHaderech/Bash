# Piping, Grep, Awk, and Redirecting Output

When our Linux machine boots up, we are often presented with many diagnostic messages that tell us what is going on during the boot process. Sometimes these are hidden, or they just move too fast to read. However, these messages are often logged for further viewing.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Login as the root user.**
   - `su -`

2. **Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where log files are kept.**
   - `cd /var/log`

3. **You are looking for a file `kern.log`.**
   - `ls`
   - Look for `kern.log` in the list.

4. **Once you find it, display the contents of the file.**
   - `cat kern.log`

5. **You may have more than one day’s diagnostic messages in this file.**
   - **Pipe the output of the cat command to grep.**
   - `cat kern.log | grep 'YOUR_DATE_PATTERN'`
   
6. **Use grep to only look at the current day’s messages.**
   - `grep 'DATE_PATTERN' kern.log`

7. **You can grep patterns with spaces by putting the pattern in quotes.**
   - `grep 'PATTERN WITH SPACES' kern.log`

8. **We only want to look at information that contains information about USB devices.**
   - `grep 'usb' kern.log`

9. **There still seems to be a lot of information here.**
   - **When a USB device is found, it looks like we get some information about the device such as its idVendor and idProduct.**
   - **Use grep again to only look for these types of lines.**
   - `grep -E 'idVendor|idProduct' kern.log`

10. **I only want the idVendor and idProduct.**
    - **Use awk to select the correct fields representing the idVendor and idProduct.**
    - **Make sure to choose an appropriate field delimiter.**
    - `grep -E 'idVendor|idProduct' kern.log | awk -F' ' '{print $FIELD_NUMBER}'`

11. **Redirect this output to a file on the desktop called usb_info.**
    - `grep -E 'idVendor|idProduct' kern.log | awk -F' ' '{print $FIELD_NUMBER}' > ~/Desktop/usb_info`

12. **Open up a web browser and Google USB ID Database.**
    - Use your browser to search for "USB ID Database".

13. **Enter in your found idVendor and idProduct numbers to gather information about your USB devices.**

14. **Clean up after yourself by removing the document from the desktop.**
    - `rm ~/Desktop/usb_info`

By following these steps, you will practice using piping, grep, awk, and redirecting output in Linux to extract and manage specific information from log files.
