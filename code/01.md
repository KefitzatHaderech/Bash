# Terminal Navigation and Manipulating Files

Moving through the Linux directory structure is a fundamental skill. Knowing where you are and how to get to where you want to go is the first step in understanding the terminal. Once you have that mastered, learning to make/remove, edit, and copy/move files is the next key step.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Open up a terminal and print your working directory.**
    - `pwd`

2. **List the contents of this directory in a long list format.**
    - `ls -l`

3. **Change directories into your Documents directory.**
    - `cd Documents`

4. **Create two new directories called playground and sandbox.**
    - `mkdir playground sandbox`

5. **Change into the playground directory and create three files named file1, file2, and file3.**
    - `cd playground`
    - `touch file1 file2 file3`

6. **Edit each file such that they contain some text of your choice.**
    - `echo "Some text for file1" > file1`
    - `echo "Some text for file2" > file2`
    - `echo "Some text for file3" > file3`

7. **Display the contents of each file to the terminal to verify the text.**
    - `cat file1`
    - `cat file2`
    - `cat file3`

8. **Copy file1 to the sandbox folder and keep the name file1.**
    - `cp file1 ../sandbox/file1`

9. **Move file2 to the sandbox folder changing the name to fileA.**
    - `mv file2 ../sandbox/fileA`

10. **Create a hard link in the sandbox folder to file3â€™s location in the playground directory.**
    - `ln file3 ../sandbox/file3`

11. **Change directories to your sandbox directory.**
    - `cd ../sandbox`

12. **Remove fileA.**
    - `rm fileA`

13. **Edit each of the remaining files to remove some of the text.**
    - `echo "Updated text for file1" > file1`
    - `echo "Updated text for file3" > file3`

14. **Display the contents of each file to the terminal to verify the changes in text.**
    - `cat file1`
    - `cat file3`

15. **Return to the playground directory. Which of these files will have changes?**
    - `cd ../playground`
    - File `file3` will have changes because it is a hard link to the file3 in the sandbox directory.

16. **Display the contents of the files to verify.**
    - `cat file3`

17. **Remove all files in the playground directory using one command.**
    - `rm *`

18. **Remove the playground directory.**
    - `cd ..`
    - `rmdir playground`

19. **Remove all files in the sandbox directory and the sandbox directory itself using one command.**
    - `rm -r sandbox`

By following these steps, you will practice navigating the terminal and manipulating files and directories in Linux.
