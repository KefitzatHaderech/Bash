# Compressing and Extracting Files

When dealing with files or directories of larger sizes, it is often convenient to compress the files for transfer or for storage purposes. Files can be compressed individually or packaged together in an archive for ease of transfer. There are many different types of compression techniques, each having their own advantages and disadvantages.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Open up a terminal and change directories to your Documents directory.**
   - `cd ~/Documents`

2. **Create a new directory called test.**
   - `mkdir test`

3. **Change directories into the new test directory.**
   - `cd test`

4. **Call a command to list all running processes on your system and redirect the output into a file called file1.**
   - `ps aux > file1`

5. **Copy file1 into a new file called file2.**
   - `cp file1 file2`

6. **View and compare the file sizes. Are they the same?**
   - `ls -l file1 file2`

7. **Copy file2 into a file called file3.**
   - `cp file2 file3`

8. **Compress file2 using gzip.**
   - `gzip file2`

9. **Compress file3 using a new compression method bzip2.**
   - `bzip2 file3`

10. **View and compare the file sizes. Are they the same?**
    - `ls -l file2.gz file3.bz2`

11. **Decompress file2.**
    - `gunzip file2.gz`

12. **Decompress file3.**
    - `bunzip2 file3.bz2`

13. **View and compare the file sizes. Are they the same?**
    - `ls -l file2 file3`

14. **Compress file2 using gzip.**
    - `gzip file2`

15. **View the file size.**
    - `ls -l file2.gz`

16. **Compress it again using bzip2.**
    - `bzip2 file2.gz`

17. **View the file size.**
    - `ls -l file2.gz.bz2`

18. **Compress it again using gzip.**
    - `gzip file2.gz.bz2`

19. **View the file size.**
    - `ls -l file2.gz.bz2.gz`

20. **Decompress the file until you have the original file back.**
    - `gunzip file2.gz.bz2.gz`
    - `bunzip2 file2.gz.bz2`
    - `gunzip file2.gz`

21. **Create an archive of all three files together.**
    - `tar -cvf test_files.tar file1 file2 file3`

22. **Move the archive to your desktop.**
    - `mv test_files.tar ~/Desktop`

23. **Change directories to your Desktop.**
    - `cd ~/Desktop`

24. **List the contents of the tar archive.**
    - `tar -tvf test_files.tar`

25. **Unpack the archive.**
    - `tar -xvf test_files.tar`

26. **Display the contents of the Desktop directory to verify the files are correct.**
    - `ls -l`

27. **Remove the archive.**
    - `rm test_files.tar`

28. **Remove the files.**
    - `rm file1 file2 file3`

29. **Remove the test directory.**
    - `rmdir ~/Documents/test`

By following these steps, you will practice using various compression techniques, creating and extracting archives, and managing files and directories in a Linux environment.
